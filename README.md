# Pass the torch!

This is an experiment in making it simpler and more convenient to know exactly
who's currently in charge of doing what in a workflow. Who's currently holding
the torch, and then who the torch should be passed to when this person is done.

## Todo

- [ ] Delete last step
- [ ] Add torches to any step
- [ ] Only allow passing the torch on a step if the previous step is done
- [ ] Add auth, and only allow a bearer to pass the torch
- [ ] Store in Kinto
